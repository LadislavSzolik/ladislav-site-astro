## Why I made the move

After designing B2B web experiences at Swisscom AG, I felt ready for a new challenge. Big corporates tought me how to navigate, get things done in a large organisations. But I wanted something where innovation is happening with higher speed.

When Ärztekasse AG offered me a Senior UX Expert role, I saw an opportunity to apply my skills where they could truly matter: healthcare. The stakes felt higher, the problems more personal.

## What I transferred

- Complex user journey and organisations.
- Handle complex design projects with large design system.
- Manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities.

## What I had to learn

- Healthcare UX operates within strict compliance frameworks. Privacy isn't just good practice—it's law.
- Medical terminology, insurance processes, and healthcare workflows required learning. But this mirrors any UX role we're constantly becoming mini-experts in our users' worlds.

## Conclusion

This transition revealed something crucial: industry expertise isn't what makes a great UX designer. It's the ability to understand users, solve problems systematically, and communicate across teams. The rest can be learned.

My telecom background actually provided unique value. I brought fresh perspectives to healthcare UX challenges, questioning assumptions that industry veterans took for granted.
